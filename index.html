<h2><strong>Bio:</strong></h2> I am a 17 year old girl who was born on January 23. My family is from the Dominican Republic, but I was born and raised in The Bronx. I live with my older brother and my parents. I am going to be applying to college in the fall, but I have no idea on what I am going to major in or what I want to do in life. Girls Who Code is a program I joined to explore and see if coding and computer science is something I would see myself doing in a couple years.
